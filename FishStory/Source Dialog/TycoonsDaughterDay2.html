I think it&#39;s hideous. But there aren&#39;t many places to move to on this dumb island... or at least none that my dad doesn&#39;t own. And I&#39;m not going to move out of his house to have him micromanaging me somewhere else.
[[Who&#39;s your dad?|Who dad]]
[[Do you not like it here?|Not like]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Who dad" tags="" position="329,741" size="100,100">The wrinkly guy with the big dumb hat? You know, the hat that screams &quot;overcompensation&quot;? You can&#39;t miss him. He bothers every single person he comes across.
[[Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Not like" tags="" position="479,741" size="100,100">What? No, I love this place. It&#39;s the people I can&#39;t stand. Or some of them, at least. There isn&#39;t a single person on this island who doesn&#39;t just think of me as &quot;Mr. Petterson&#39;s daughter.&quot;
[[Continue2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Continue" tags="" position="329,891" size="100,100">And you&#39;re not savvy to his schemes yet, so I&#39;d bet that all he sees when he looks at you is a walking dollar sign.
[[He seemed nice when I talked to him.|Seemed nice]]
[[Thanks for the warning.|warning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Seemed nice" tags="" position="177,1041" size="100,100">No offence, but you seem a little naive. Just... try not to make anyone mad, okay? Small towners usually have a bit of a mob mentality, and you don&#39;t want that mob to have its sights set on you.
[[Bad bye]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="warning" tags="" position="327,1041" size="100,100">No problem. And if you want a little more advice, try to avoid making anyone mad. Including my dad, if you can stand it. Small towners usually have a bit of a mob mentality, and you don&#39;t want that mob to have its sights set on you.
[[Good Bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Continue2" tags="" position="479,891" size="100,100">Well, except for the priestess. And that other stranger who arrived last month... I hope these other idiots don&#39;t scare her away before I can make a good impression.
[[Why would they sacare her away?|Scare her away]]
[[Why do you care about making a good impression?|Impression]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Scare her away" tags="" position="481,1041" size="100,100">You know, normal small town stuff. They make you feel welcomed at first, but if they get a single whiff of you not being just like them, they freeze you out. But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve dealt with that already.
[[Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed that.|Noticed]]
[[Actually, everyone has been pretty nice to me so far!|Nice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Impression" tags="" position="724,1041" size="100,100">Look, there aren&#39;t many oppertunities to meet new people here. Not many people bother to come out this far, and those that do are usually kinda...
[[Continue3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Noticed" tags="" position="544,1190" size="100,100">It would be hard not to. Just try not to make anyone mad. Small towners usually have a bit of a mob mentality, and you don&#39;t want that mob to have its sights set on you.
[[Good Bye]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Nice" tags="" position="426,1188" size="100,100">Huh. Well, then you&#39;re doing better than me already.
[[Bad bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Continue3" tags="" position="724,1191" size="100,100">Well, just not the type of people I want to be around. So it gets pretty lonely here. I&#39;ve only talked to Sofia a few times, but she seems different. She&#39;s smart. And cultured. We don&#39;t have much of either of those things here.
[[Good Bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Good Bye" tags="" position="724,1341" size="100,100">Well, I have to get back to my chores.
