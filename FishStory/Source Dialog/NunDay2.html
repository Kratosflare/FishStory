Can I help you with something?

[[Tell me about the festival.|Festival]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="nope" tags="" position="296,818" size="100,100">Oh, well, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s a little odd that you came to talk to me even though you don&#39;t have anything to say... But, no matter. Do let me know if I can help you with something.
[[Bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Festival" tags="" position="603,713" size="100,100">Ah, well, it&#39;s a bit sacred, you see, and by extension, it&#39;s a bit of a secret. Our traditions have been passed down for so long that no one knows where they came from. But they maintain our community and our collective spirit.
[[continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Bye" tags="HasSeenNunDay2" position="421,1401" size="100,100">May the tides flow in your favor.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="continue" tags="" position="601,834" size="100,100">So, you&#39;ll have to forgive me if I can&#39;t share much of our ways with an outsider.
[[That&#39;s alright.|Alright]]
[[Tell me anyway.|Tell me]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Alright" tags="" position="521,956" size="100,100">Ah, it is quite refreshing to meet a stranger who knows their place. I was a bit worried that you would end up like that other woman. She was rather nosey, wasn&#39;t she?
[[Did she leave the island?|Leave]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Tell me" tags="" position="675,956" size="100,100">Hmm. You know, I do believe I&#39;ve been rather kind to you, even though you are an uninvited stranger. So I find it quite odd that you insist on being consistently pushy and presumptuous.
[[continue2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="continue2" tags="" position="742,1106" size="100,100">Certainly, if I were a stranger in an unknown land with unfamiliar customs, I would make an effort to not make myself known for unfavorable traits, wouldn&#39;t you?
[[Sorry...|Sorry]]
[[I&#39;m not scared.|Not scared]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Sorry" tags="" position="705,1263" size="100,100">There is no need to apologize to me. After all, I am not the one you run the risk of offending.
[[Bye]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Not scared" tags="" position="828,1354" size="100,100">Scared? Whatever made you think you should be scared? Presently, you will find nothing to fear upon this island. I assure you.
[[Bye]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Leave" tags="" position="521,1073" size="100,100">Oh, no, not yet. But I do believe she has made plans to leave by tomorrow morning. After all, she must know by now that we have no more information we&#39;re willing to part with. I&#39;m afraid her book will have to go on without us, as it were.
[[But I thought no one could leave until after the festival?|Leave until after]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Leave until after" tags="" position="514,1206" size="100,100">Yes, yes, this is true. But she seems to have made special arrangements. It cost her a great sum of money as well. It must be nice to be so metropolitan and have no many resources at your fingertips... I&#39;m sure neither of us can relate to such frivolous behavior.
