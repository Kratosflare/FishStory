She left of her own accord. She hired a private boat to take her off the island. Said she was too used to fancy city life to withstand our more &quot;unrefined&quot; ways...
[[That doesn&#39;t sound like her.|Doesnt sound]]

Two days? What do you know? She was a stranger, and she had no business being here during the festival without participating. It&#39;s no wonder she couldn&#39;t hack it.
[[I&#39;m going to get back to fishing.|bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="forbidden boats" tags="" position="549.5,1338" size="100,100">Well... They are. But she hired a sailboat, so no engine to disturb the wildlife. Besides, we all wanted her gone so bad, none of us were going to object.
