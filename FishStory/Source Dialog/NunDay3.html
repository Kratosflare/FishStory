They don&#39;t seem to understand how insulting that is to our way of life! Our practices are not some circus to be observed with a desire to be entertained.

Well, her presence certainly wasn&#39;t ideal, but she was only the tip of the iceberg. Year after year, there&#39;s always one or two people who hear about our community one way or another and decides to try and violate our sacred rite.

But I&#39;m proud to say that we&#39;ve yet to have a non-participant witness the festival!
