[[It&#39;s perfect, thank you!|Perfect]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Drafty" tags="" position="420,709" size="100,100">Well of course it is! How else would you fully take in the fresh sea air that you traveled so far to enjoy?

You have the critical eye of an artist! And I&#39;m sure an artist such as yourself would be simply ecstatic at the opportunity to take in everything this wonderful location has to offer.

Well, regardless, you don&#39;t have to be on vacation to enjoy everything this wonderful location has to offer! Can I interest you in a scenic boat ride? For a small fee, of course.

[[No thanks. I have to get back to fishing.|Fishing to do]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Youre right" tags="" position="229,863" size="100,100">Yes, yes. See, for a moment there, it almost seemed like you weren&#39;t grateful for the generosity I&#39;ve bestowed upon you. Almost as if I hadn&#39;t provided you with a sturdy roof over your head when I was under no obligation to do so.
[[Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Mainland" tags="" position="572,1015" size="100,100">Oh no, of course not. This is a strictly leisure-oriented activity. Besides, the only boat capable of making a journey through waters that rough won&#39;t be leaving until after the festival.

I have better things to do that listen to a stranger - a beggarly stranger, no less - lecture me about the integrity of my facilities. And I trust that you do as well. Or do you spend the majority of your time accosting innocent small business owners?
