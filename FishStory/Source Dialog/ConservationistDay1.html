[[Do I know you?|Know you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Know you" tags="" position="508,390" size="100,100">Nope! But that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m so excited to see you. I came here about a month ago in order to conduct research for a book about harvest celebrations, but I can&#39;t get anyone in this entire town to talk to me for more than thirty seconds.

All anyone wants to talk about on this tiny island is their precious festival, but I can never get anyone to give me any details on any of the customs or rituals.

I have a feeling that there has to be at least one interesting thing to learn from these people. Otherwise I&#39;ll have made this trip for nothing...
[[I&#39;ll let you know if I find anything.|Bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="No involved" tags="" position="569,798" size="100,100">No? Well, it&#39;s up to you, but if you want my opinion, it seems near impossible to stay uninvolved in this town. For what little information these people offer up about themselves, they sure have seemed interested in me since I arrived...
