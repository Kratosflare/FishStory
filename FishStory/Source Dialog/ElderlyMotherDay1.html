I&#39;m so sorry dear, but I can&#39;t seem to remember your name. Don’t take it personally, I&#39;m afraid that’s been happening quite often these past few years.

[[Yes.|Met William]]
[[Not yet.|Have Not Met William]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Let it slide" tags="" position="680,375" size="100,100">Oh, well, that&#39;s very kind of you. Tell me, are you looking forward to the festival?
[[Of course! It sounds exciting.|Looking forward to festival]]

[[No, not really.|Not looking forward to festival]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Met William" tags="" position="237,530" size="100,100">He&#39;s quite the young man, isn&#39;t he? We&#39;re all rather proud of him. He took that old shop — the old bookstore, or whatever it used to be — and transformed it into quite the practical establishment. He fixed it up with his own two hands... and a bit of financial assistance from Mr. Petterson.
[[end]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Have Not Met William" tags="" position="371,530" size="100,100">Oh, well, you should certainly fix that as soon as you can! He runs the bait shop. The classy bait shop, not that old shack by the waterfront. William fixed the old building up with his own two hands... and a bit of financial assistance from Mr. Petterson. We&#39;re all rather proud of him.
[[end]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Looking forward to festival" tags="" position="530,526" size="100,100">Oh, I&#39;m glad! It warms my heart to see young people as excited for the festival as I am. Someone&#39;s going to have to keep our traditions alive after I&#39;m gone, or else everything falls apart.
[[continue2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Iffy about festival" tags="" position="680,525" size="100,100">Oh dear, why is that? Did you not enjoy last year&#39;s festival? It was quite grand, what with the feast, the dancing, and of course, The Choosing... I do so enjoy the theatrics of it all. But maybe I&#39;m just old fashioned. Well, it was nice speaking with you.
[[end]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Not looking forward to festival" tags="" position="830,525" size="100,100">Good heavens, why not? It&#39;s the only exciting thing that happens in this town, anymore. Or are you one of those, oh what are they called... modernists?

But between you and me, I can&#39;t imagine her lasting long here. People like her never do.
[[end]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="continue2" tags="" position="531,652" size="100,100">William has never been one for tradition, so the duty may just fall on your shoulders. Well, yours and the church&#39;s, of course.
