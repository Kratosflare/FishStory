You have protected us from those who are ignorant to your godliness, and so we have prospered! And now, you have called out from your deepest depths with demands of restitution. And so we have listened!

The greater good demands the sacrifice of the individual. The priestess is more than happy to oblige. This is her purpose. She always knew that the tides could flow in her favor... as did I.
