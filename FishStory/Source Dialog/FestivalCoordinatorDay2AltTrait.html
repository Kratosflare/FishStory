The type of fish you catch have a big impact on the festival. Did you know that you can check the sign in the town square to see which fish have been turned in to Jacob so far? [[yikes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="yikes" tags="" position="412,791.5" size="100,100">Yikes! You sure are catching a lot of Cobia! You know, I think the festival might turn out, um, better, if you branched out a little. Cobia tend to live on the north coast of the island. Why don&#39;t you fish somewhere else today?[[I&#39;ll keep that in mind]][[The fishmonger pays big bucks for Cobia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="I&#39;ll keep that in mind" tags="" position="337,941.5" size="100,100">Cobia are the huge dark fish. If you wind up catching one, you can always sell an untagged one to that creepy vendor with the backpack that comes out at night. Then it won&#39;t affect the official fish count on the sign.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The fishmonger pays big bucks for Cobia." tags="" position="487,941.5" size="100,100">Look, Cobia are the huge dark fish. If you need money that bad, you can always sell an untagged one to that creepy vendor with the backpack that comes out at night. Then it won&#39;t affect the official fish count on the sign.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
