Lately I&#39;ve been thinking of that long ago day when you left us for your journey. I remember vowing to never enjoy the taste of shrimp again, for it made me think only of losing you...
[[continuealt]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Continue2" tags="" position="629,598" size="100,100">I have always thought that it shouldn&#39;t have been you. You had so much to look forward to here! That farmer boy, what was his name... Harald! He liked you ever so much. I do believe that you would have had such a bountiful future with him. But, such is the way of things...

[[I have to go now.|bye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="continuealt" tags="" position="286,999" size="100,100">But I must admit, as time went on and I began to heal, the aroma of the fish cooking over my mother&#39;s stove began to smell sweet again. It seems that no one can stay angry at the sea for long. Even though it may cast us away, it always pulls us back to it, like pebbles caught in the paths of breaking waves. And in doing so, it wears down our rough edges, making us all the more beautiful through its power.
[[continuealt2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="continuealt2" tags="" position="286,1149" size="100,100">There have been an awful lot of Rougheyes caught lately, and I suppose at my age, I should begin to worry about such things. But I will not. If the sea chooses me, I will be glad. I see it as the greatest honor, as I&#39;m sure you did when you were chosen.
