You and every other stranger who bothers to make the journey to this barren island. The last time I had another pair of hands to help me with the harvest, I was young and dumb enough to believe I would someday get out of this place. Oh well... You look a little too scrawny to help me, anyway.

I&#39;ve gotten through every other festival season without help, and I can do it again. If Anthony wants lefse for the feast, who am I to say no? Do you have any idea how many potatoes it takes to make enough lefse for the entire town? Of course not! And neither does Anthony, apparently, because he expects me to have everything harvested and cleaned with a day to spare!
[[Are you sure you don&#39;t want help?-&gt;Sure help]]
[[Well, good luck with that!-&gt;Good luck]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Rude" tags="" position="674.5,540.5" size="100,100">You&#39;re just like my son. All fire but no heat. Where is he, anyway? What&#39;s he got to do that&#39;s better than picking potatoes? By the way, do you have any idea how many potatoes it takes to make enough lefse for the entire town? Of course not! And neither does my son, apparently, because instead of helping me harvest and clean everything, he&#39;s down by that rickety shack of his hawking bait!
[[Well, good luck with that!-&gt;Good luck]]
[[You think he would give me a discount on bait?-&gt;Discount]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Sure help" tags="" position="277.5,687.5" size="100,100">Bah... I&#39;m sure. I got a son, don&#39;t I? If I need help, I&#39;ll get it from him before I bother anyone else. Ain&#39;t that the whole point of having a son in the first place?
[[Bye.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Good luck" tags="" position="427.5,687.5" size="100,100">I don&#39;t need luck. I got a son, don&#39;t I? He&#39;ll be helping me whether he likes it or not. Ain&#39;t that the whole point of having a son in the first place?
