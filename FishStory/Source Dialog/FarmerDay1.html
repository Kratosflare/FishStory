You and every other stranger who bothers to make the journey to this barren island. The last time I had another pair of hands to help me with the harvest, I was young and dumb enough to believe I would someday get out of this place.

I&#39;ve gotten through every other festival season without help, and I can do it again. If Anthony wants lefse for the feast, who am I to say no? Do you have any idea how many potatoes it takes to make enough lefse for the entire town? Of course not!

What&#39;s he got to do that&#39;s better than picking potatoes? By the way, do you have any idea how many potatoes it takes to make enough lefse for the entire town? Of course not!
