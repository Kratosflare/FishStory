Ensomme is one with the land and entangled with the sea. Just by walking across our sacred beaches and staring into the bewitching depths of our ocean, you are taking part in our traditions. I’m sure that you will make efforts to do so in a respectful manner, yes?

This land has a way of rebalancing things when our actions go against the divine plans of nature. One moment, it may direct the sea&#39;s wrath towards Ensomme, sending us storms of bitter winds and brackish water.
