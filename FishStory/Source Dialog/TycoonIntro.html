[[I&#39;m just here to fish.|Fish]]
[[Which city?|City]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Fish" tags="" position="433,390" size="100,100">Ah, yes! Fishing is wonderful, isn&#39;t it? One of my top ten favorite leisure activities! And, as luck may have it, one of our premiere vacation experiences! I can offer you some top-of-the-line, beginner-friendly fishing classes, perfect for your holiday! How does that sound?
[[Sorry, I&#39;m not here for vacation.|No vacation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="City" tags="" position="583,390" size="100,100">Any city! Preferably one with lots of overworked and overpaid urbanites who you can tell about the beautiful, tranquil, and rejuvenating town you visited on your vacation!
[[Sorry, I&#39;m just here to work.|No vacation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="No vacation" tags="" position="509,543" size="100,100">Bah! You&#39;re just as frustrating as the rest of this town! Why is everyone so afraid of progress? Can&#39;t they see the oppertunities provided by a naturally beautiful town like this? I&#39;m talking development! Jobs! Income!
[[Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Back to it" tags="" position="513,791" size="100,100">Wait! If you&#39;re new here, you&#39;ll be needing a place to stay. Fortunately, I happen to have a vacancy in my luxury mobile home facility. But those lodgings are reserved for the town&#39;s working class, and I don&#39;t give handouts. 
[[BackToItCONTD]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="BackToItCONTD" tags="" position="513,941" size="100,100">So if you want to have a place to stay, you&#39;ll have to contribute to the town as a whole. Come back once you&#39;ve caught three fish and had them officially recorded by Jacob, the identifier at the church. Then I&#39;ll know you&#39;re not a freeloader.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Continue" tags="" position="510,665" size="100,100">But most of these simpletons would rather leave their futures up to fate than take it into their own hands!
