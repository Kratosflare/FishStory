[[alright]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="alright" tags="" position="539.5,722.5" size="100,100">I walked by the sign in the square with all the identified fish counts and saw how many trumpetfish have been caught during the festival. I thought maybe it would make more sense to maybe catch diverse fish, right? We don&#39;t want to overfish trumpetfish, right? Maybe you could avoid fishing on the east shore? Or maybe you could use less squid for bait? I&#39;ve heard trumpetfish are most attracted to squid.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
