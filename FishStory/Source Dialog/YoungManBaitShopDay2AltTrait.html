[[alright]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="alright" tags="" position="539.5,722.5" size="100,100">I walked by the sign in the square with all the identified fish counts and saw how many trumpetfish have been caught. Wouldn't it make more sense to catch more diverse fish? We don&#39;t want to overfish trumpetfish, right? Maybe you could avoid fishing on the east shore? Or maybe you could use less squid for bait? I&#39;ve heard trumpetfish are attracted to squid.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
